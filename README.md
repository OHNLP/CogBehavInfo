# A General Purpose Cognitive-behavioral Symptom Taxonomy

## Motivation
Cognitive-behavior symptoms (CBSx) represent the surface manifestation of diverse etiology. Identification and documentation of CBSx are critical to biomedical research that targets understanding the association between the symptoms and the underlying causes including genetics, aging, injury, substance use, or infection. Seeing the lack of a semantic resource of CBSx, specifically dedicated to the symptom layer, we sought to develop a CBSx Taxonomy.

## CBSx Taxonomy Overview
The derived taxonomy contains 258 concepts that are grouped into four major branches: cognitive symptoms, psychomotor symptoms, behavioral symptoms, and impact on life. The taxonomy has been implemented into a computable format and made available to the research community.
